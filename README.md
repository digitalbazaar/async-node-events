# async-node-events

An EventEmitter replacement that allows both asynchronous and synchronous
emissions and handlers. This is entirely based off of and almost entirely
written by @dfellis in his excellent
[async-cancelable-events](https://github.com/dfellis/async-cancelable-events)
module. Even this README is primarily written by @dfellis. Recent updates are
from Digital Bazaar.

This version is primarily targeted at using Promises and async/await with
``emit`` and listeners. Namely, the asynchronous ``emit`` will return a Promise
which can be awaited upon. Listeners are run in series and their result is
awaited upon. Throwing an error from a listener that executed asynchronously
will terminate the listener chain (subsequent listeners will not receive the
emitted event and the ``emit`` Promise will be rejected. Events may also be
canceled by a listener resolving to or returning `false`. This will stop
further event emission to other listeners and return `false` rather than
`undefined`, but not raise an error.

The synchronous ``emitSync`` variant acts like the asynchronous ``emit`` but
only allows synchronous listeners.

The listener manipulation methods (``on``, ``off``, etc) are synchronous and
use ``emitSync`` to emit ``newListener``, ``removeListener``, and
``maxListenersPassed``. Listeners for these events must be synchronous.

## Install

```sh
npm install async-node-events
```

## Usage

```js
var EventEmitter = require('async-node-events').EventEmitter;
var util = require('util');

(async () => {
  const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();
  myEmitter.on('test', async (...) => {
    ...
  });
  await myEmitter.emit('test', ...);
})();

function MyEmittingObject() {
  EventEmitter.call(this);
  ...
}

util.inherits(MyEmittingObject, EventEmitter);
```

The API is intended to be a mostly-drop-in replacement for Node.js'
`EventEmitter` object, except with support for asynchronous listeners.

The primary differences between the `EventEmitter` and `async-node-events` are:

1. Passing the maximum number of listeners allowed will fire off a
   ``maxListenersPassed`` event with the event name and listener count as
   arguments. The warning the official ``EventEmitter`` prints is simply a
   listener for ``async-node-events``, and can be disabled by running
   ``this.removeAllListeners('maxListenersPassed')`` just after the
   ``EventEmitter.call(this)`` listed above.
2. The various synchronous method calls are chainable, so ``foo.on('bar',
   func1).on('baz', func2)`` is valid.
3. ``emit`` and ``emitSync`` return `undefined` if the even was emitted to all
   listeners and `false` when a listener caused cancellation. This differs from
   returning an indication if there were listeners.
